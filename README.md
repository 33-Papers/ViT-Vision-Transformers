# Vision Transformer (ViT) Replication

This repository contains the code and resources for replicating the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, a deep learning model that has shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. 

## Introduction
The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a neural network architecture that applies the principles of the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to computer vision tasks. ViT has shown competitive performance on image classification tasks and is known for its simplicity and scalability.

This project aims to replicate the Vision Transformer (ViT) paper titled "An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" using PyTorch, providing a complete codebase to train and evaluate the model on standard image classification datasets. 

## Paper & Code Reference
You can access the paper using the following link: [ViT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). This paper provides in-depth information about the ViT architecture, its applications, and experimental results.

The official GitHub repository for the Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation by Google Research can be found at: [ViT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer). This repository contains the source code, pre-trained models, and resources related to the Vision Transformer.
